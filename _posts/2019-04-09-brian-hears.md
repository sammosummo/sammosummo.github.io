This week, [Dan Goodman](http://neural-reckoning.org/dan_goodman.html) at [Imperial College London](http://neural-reckoning.org/) released a new version of [Brian hears](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2hears). Brian hears, also called `brian2hears`, is a Python package for auditory modeling ([documentation](https://brian2hears.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)). It was originally a component of [Brian](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), a more general scientific package for simulating spiking neural networks. While Brian’s feature set extended far beyond my own research interests and understanding of neural modeling, I used the ‘hears sub-package quite a bit as a postdoc, for both autodidactism and actual experimental work. A few years ago, Brian received a major update and became Brian 2, but ‘hears didn’t make the cut. Now, an updated version has appeared as a standalone package, although Brian 2 is a dependency.

I’m writing this because it changes my plans for _The Cracked Bassoon_ slightly. So far I’ve written about sound synthesis in Python (actually, that’s all I’ve written about). Brian hears does exactly this, so I’m going to take a break from writing on this topic while I check it out. Dan is an excellent scientist and his lab produces fascinating work, so I’m bound to learn a few new things. I can’t wait to dive into the source code!
