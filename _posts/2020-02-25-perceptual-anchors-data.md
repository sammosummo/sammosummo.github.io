I'm very pleased to announce the publication of a new paper written by myself, Lenny Varghese, Christophe Micheyl, and
Barb Shinn-Cunnigham about using perceptual anchors during frequency discrimination [(Mathias et al., 2020)](#Mathias2020a).
The code and data from this paper now publically available via a
[github repository](https://github.com/sammosummo/PerceptualAnchorsPublic).
