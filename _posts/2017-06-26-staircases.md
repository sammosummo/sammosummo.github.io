title: Staircases
---

In psychophysics, _staircases_ are experimental procedures that estimate a point
on the psychometric function by manipulating the dependent variable based on
the participant's response history. Many such procedures have been proposed, but
perhaps the most widely used staircase is the transformed up-down method (TUDM)
by Levitt (1971). My personal favourite is Kaernbach's weighted up-down method
(WUDM), which I have used in some of my previous work (Mathias et al., 2010; 2011).
I prefer it to the TUDM because it can estimate any point on the psychometric
function—with the TUDM, one is limited to a small number of values (50%, 70.9%,
etc.)—and is slightly more efficient (~10% better than the TUDM, according to
Rammsayer, 1992). Another advantage is that it is a tiny bit easier to code,
since one doesn't have to keep track of how many trials the participant has
already gotten correct or incorrect.
