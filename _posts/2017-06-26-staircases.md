title: Staircases
---

In psychophysics, _staircases_ are experimental procedures that estimate a point
on the psychometric function by manipulating the dependent variable based on
the participant's response history. Many such procedures have been proposed, but
perhaps the most widely used staircase is the transformed up-down method (TUDM)
by Levitt (1971). Personally I prefer is Kaernbach's weighted up-down method
(WUDM), which I have used in some of my previous work (Mathias et al., 2010; 2011),
because it can estimate any point on the psychometric function—with the TUDM, one
is limited to a small number of values (50%, 70.9%, etc.)—and is slightly
more efficient (~10% better than the TUDM, according to Rammsayer, 1992).
