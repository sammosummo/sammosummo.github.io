I'm very pleased to announce the publication of two new first-author papers. The first, which I co-wrote with Lenny
Varghese, Christophe Micheyl, and Barb Shinn-Cunnigham, reports one of the experiments I conducted as a postdoc in
Barb's lab [(Mathias et al., 2020)](#Mathias2020a). In this paper, we constructed a Bayesian model to explain listeners'
choices in a frequency-discrimination experiment. The data were collected several years ago while I was a postdoc in
Barb's lab. This paper was a very long time coming, but better late than never!

The code and data are publicly available in a [github repository](https://github.com/sammosummo/PerceptualAnchorsPublic).

The second paper, which may be of interest to a broader readership, is about the relationship between the amount of
cortical folding ([gyrification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrification)) and general cognitive ability
([*g*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics))). In this paper, we attempted to replicate previous
studies that reported correlations between these traits, and determine whether such correlations were caused by
overlapping genetic influences. We found that while gyrification and *g* were indeed genetically correlated, the
relationship between them was incredibly weak [(Mathias et al., 2020)](#Mathias2020b). 

This paper used data from the [Genetics of Brain Structure and Function Study (GOBS)](http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R01-MH078111-01)
and the [Human Connectome Project (HCP)](http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/). Since I wasn't part of the
investigative teams that collected these data, I'm not at liberty to share them. However, the HCP data is available for
free to all *bone fide* researchers, and the application process is extremely straightforward.
