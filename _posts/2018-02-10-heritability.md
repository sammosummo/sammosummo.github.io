Heritability remains one of the core concepts in quantitative genetics. It is actually quite easy to build a model to estimate the heritability of a quantitative trait, provided one knows the familial relationships between individuals in the sample.

The total or phenotypic variance of a trait has both a genetic and environmental component:

$$
\sigma^2_\textrm{P} = \sigma^2_\textrm{G} + \sigma^2_\textrm{E}
$$
