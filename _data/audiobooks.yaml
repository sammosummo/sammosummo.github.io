  book_review: >-
    A collection of not-bad short stories set before the events of the novels. I listened to this after playing CD
    Projekt Red’s phenomenal <i>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</i> and watching moderately-fun-but-naff Netflix show. Geralt
    is a bit more proactive (and a lot less boring) than in the show, though everyone else is a one-note stereotype,
    especially the women. The lore is interesting. Favorite story by far: “A Grain of Truth.”
  performance_review: >-
    Really excellent, except for one thing: Geralt is given a cod Northern English accent—somewhere
    between Lancashire and Yorkshire—with a pronounced vocal fry and a hint of an impediment when played at high speed.
    Other listeners may not notice or care, but to me this sounds ridiculous, like Frank Sidebottom.

    Second collection of short stories in The Witcher series. Not as good as <i>The Last Wish</i>—in fact, I was bored.
    “The Bounds of Reason” was decent. “A Little Sacrifice” stuck out for its outrageous sexism, which is saying a lot
    for a Sapkowski story. <span class="spoiler2"> While fleeing for his life, Geralt somehow has the time to turn round
    and admire his pursuer’s breasts. Also there’s a female character who exists, literally, just to fuck Geralt then
    die.</span>

    My favorite novel of all time. Read or go listen.
  performance_review: >-
    This production is clearly of extremely high quality, and despite some reservations, I think it does justice to the
    writing. The frequent changes in viewpoint and quotations from secondary sources naturally require the full cast,
    and while the ensemble largely does an excellent job, there are some unintentional and clanging juxtapositions in
    both talent and recording quality. Offerman and Sedaris are stellar, so it’s fortunate we hear from them the most.
    Saunders himself is OK, but sounded quite monotone—a shame, because the Rev’s journey had the most pathos for me.
    Much of the remaining cast is good, making the occasional dud all the more jarring.

    I'm not saying it’s bad, but I was quite disappointed. I don’t think the quality of writing declined or that the
    characters behaved any less impulsively and selfishly (i.e., realistically) in this novel than the previous ones.
    I just found Elena’s current circumstances uninteresting and her perspective whingy. In my opinion,
    writers writing about writers can be a crushingly dull topic—unless its Steven King writing about himself in
    <i>On Writing</i>; that’s a great book! I don’t know if something was lost in translation or what, but great
    swathes of <i>Those Who Leave</i> are devoted to characters engaged in bafflingly generic political discourse—
    the government are not acting in the interests of the people, and so on—without mentioning specific people or
    events, contributing to the overall dullness.

    I'm conflicted about O’Connor. Without doubt her short stories are masterpieces: her characters are these
    exquisitely grotesque exemplars of the worst aspects of human nature, and her writing is powerful and grim. I
    absolutely love that kind of stuff. Naturally, O’Connor deals with a lot of difficult topics, including the
    appalling of racism of whites in the southern USA of the fifties, similar to Harper Lee’s <i>To Kill a
    Mockingbird</i>. But while Lee critically examines racism and makes a clear stand against it, for O’Connor it’s
    just <i>there</i>, and I found all the racial slurs difficult to process.

    It’s a proper BBC radio play! Makes sense to have done it this way since Lem hated the original English translation,
    although the more recent Audible version is supposed to be good as well.

    My favorite fantasy series. It gets lauded, rightly so, for its dark tone, moral ambiguity, and realistic depiction
    of war (for a fantasy series). I found it refreshingly original. Cook doesn’t get bogged down in lore, and calls a
    spade a spade (not <a href="https://www.sfwa.org/2009/06/18/turkey-city-lexicon-a-primer-for-sf-workshops/">a rabbit a smeerp</a>).
    Members of the company are all interesting, wizards are entertainingly grotesque and way over the top, and locations
    have a wonderful grimy feel to them.
  performance_review: Vietor’s non-nonsense narration works well.

    To give credit where it’s due, Sanderson certainly puts his back into it. In my view, this series (the Stormlight
    Archive) is his best work, and this is the best of the three novels published so far. There are some problems, such
    as the occasional terrible attempts at humor, and the one-note characters. The writing is decent, but doesn’t have
    much flair. But if you’re here, you’re here for the premise, the plot, and the lore—<i>The Way of Kings</i> has
    those in spades. I think it’s well paced, despite the length.

    This is the first novel of the Mistborn series, and is pretty good overall. The thousand-year old immortal despot is
    a cool idea. Kelsier is above-average in terms of depth for one of Sanderson’s characters, and the rest of his crew,
    while somewhat one-dimensional, are enjoyable. Vin and Eland are dull as dishwater, which gets to be a bigger
    problem for me in the later novels. Some people prefer this to <i>The Way of Kings</i> because the plotting is
    tighter.

    I listened to this after watching the excellent TV show. Despite being an almost scene-for-scene translation, somehow
    the show ends up being considerably better. SF and fantasy tend to be sexist, unfortunately, and this is certainly
    the case here—I counted exactly one female character Holden didn’t do or consider doing (she was in a different part
    of the solar system).
  performance_review: Mays does a good job with the Belter patois.

    I remember reading this in paper form as a teenager and being blown away by it. After listening to it as an adult, I
    don’t know what I was thinking. Certainly there’s some iconic stuff in here—the spice, the sandworms, “fear is the
    mind killer”—but the writing is crap and there is absolutely no tension. <span class="spoiler2">Paul starts to display prodigious talents
    right away, and by the halfway point, he’s a Mentat, a military genius, a master duelist, the
    messiah to the Fremen and the Bene Gesserit, and can see into the future! Nobody reading this would ever worry that
    this kid is in any kind of danger.</span> And the plot holes! <span class="spoiler2">If
    spice is necessary for interstellar travel, how did anybody get to Arrakis and find the stuff in the first place? Could
    Yueh seriously not come up with a better assassination plan, why not just shoot the guy?</span>.

    I think it’s very easy to be snobbish about King’s work and especially his output from the last two or three decades. I liked a
    few of his early horrors as a kid, and <i>On Writing</i> is one of the finest books written about writing. Some online
    reviews suggest that <i>Revival</i> is a partial return to form. I thought it was complete pants. It’s just so clear that King didn’t do any research for this book whatsoever. For example, <span class="spoiler2">the protagonist's brother gets into an accident that renders him mute without any other physical or
        neurological problems (what causes this?) and later gets cured via <i>something</i> to do with electricity. Moreover,
    the antagonist has a big sermon about halfway through that sounds incredibly inauthentic, like a teenager’s take on
    organized religion rather than a grief-stricken man giving up his life's work.</span>
  performance_review: Morse is actually really good, shame about the content.

    People like to say that the movie butchered the source material. It didn’t, the source material is rubbish. The story

    The titular story gets a

        writing isn't very good, either. The other stories in the collection range from forgettable to groan-inducing; I
        couldn't get through them all. I remember the performance being a bit weird.
