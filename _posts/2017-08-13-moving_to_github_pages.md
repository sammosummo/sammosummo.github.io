title: Moving to GitHub pages
---
Welcome to my new blog! I’m in the process of moving my site over to
["https://pages.github.com](GitHub pages). My original site
was hosted by DreamHost. While I was very happy with DreamHost’s
products and services, their affordable Shared Hosting plan had one
major drawback: slow loading times. I mean _super_ slow. It wasn’t all
that obvious on a home or mobile connection, but on a faster
connections, such as in my office, pages would load noticeably slower
than those of other websites. I imagine that most readers of my stuff
will be academics, and academic institutions tend to have pretty fast
networks, so I expect others will experience or might have already
experienced this slowness. Therefore, I'm moving.

GitHub pages is integrated with the static site-generating software [http://jekyllrb.com](Jekyll) ,


, and since it is likely that most readers will be
academics, I expect
that I won’t be

which is now hosted by GitHub pages
