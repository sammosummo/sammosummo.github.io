Looking closely at the {{ site.data.refs.Holzinger1939a.citet }} data, one can see that they are test scores. Unlike
normally distributed random variables, they are integers and have lower and upper bounds (0 and whatever the maximum
score on a particular test was). Thus, one might argue that they are binomially distributed,

$$\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{y}\sim\mathrm{Binomial}\left(\boldsymbol{\pi}, \boldsymbol{k}\right)
\end{equation}$$

where $$\boldsymbol{\pi}$$ is the probability of a correct response on a question on the test and $$\boldsymbol{k}$$ is the
maximum possible score. We can now use the same logic as logistic regression to connect items to our latent variables:

$$\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\pi}=\mathrm{logistic}\left(\boldsymbol{\hat{\pi}}\right)\\
\boldsymbol{\hat{\pi}}=\boldsymbol{\nu}+\boldsymbol{\Lambda}\boldsymbol{\eta}+\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\\
\boldsymbol{\eta} = (\boldsymbol{I} - \boldsymbol{\Gamma})^{-1} (\boldsymbol{\alpha}+\boldsymbol{\zeta})\\
\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\sim\mathrm{Normal}\left(0, \boldsymbol{\theta}\right)\\
\boldsymbol{\zeta}\sim\mathrm{Normal}\left(0, \boldsymbol{\psi}\right)
\end{equation}$$

The most commonly used generalization of linear models for binomial data is logistic regression. It is relatively easy
to modify the univariate model in the previous section so that the logit of the probability of a correct response is a
normally distributed latent variable which loads on the previously defined latent variables
