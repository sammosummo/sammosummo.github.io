cocktails:
 - name: Classic Negroni
   ingredients: [  1 ounce London dry gin, 1 ounce Campari, 1 ounce sweet red vermouth, 1 orange (for garnish)]
   recipe: >-
     Shake the liquid ingredients with ice. Strain into a short glass over ice. Garnish with
     an orange twist.
   notes: >-
     It’s hard to go wrong with this classic cockail, but it is improved considerably by
     getting the alcohol really cold beforehand and using a good quality gin, such as
     Sipsmith. Vermouth is not a spirit; it’s a fortified white wine. Therefore it should
     be stored in the fridge and used within a week or two of opening. Aperol works just
     as well as Campari.

 - name: Espresso Martini
   ingredients: [ 1 ½ ounce vodka, ½ ounce Kahlúa, ½ ounce creme de cacao, ½ ounce espresso or any other coffee]
   recipe: >-
     Brew the coffee and let it cool, then stir the ingredients with ice. Strain into a
     martini glass.
   notes: >-
     If you don’t have an espresso maker at home, a French press works well. Make your
     coffee in the morning and leave a little in the press until the evening. The leftover
     liquid will be nice and strong. You can also freeze any remaining coffee into ice
     cubes and use those when stirring your next martini.

 - name: Suze
   ingredients: [ 2 ounces Suze, tonic or soda, 1 lemon (for garnish) ]
   recipe: >-
     Pour the Suze over ice. Top with tonic or soda, to taste. Garnish with a lemon twist.
   notes: >-
     Suze is a French apéritif flavored with gentian. It is delicious on its own so
     don’t overdo it with the mixer. It can be a little difficult to find in the USA.
