AB  - BACKGROUND: Suicide is major public health concern. It is imperative to find
      robust biomarkers so that at-risk individuals can be identified in a timely and
      reliable manner. Previous work suggests mechanistic links between increased
      cytokines and risk for suicide, but questions remain regarding the etiology of
      this association, as well as the roles of sex and BMI. METHODS: Analyses were
      conducted using a randomly-ascertained extended-pedigree sample of 1882
      Mexican-American individuals (60% female, mean age=42.04, range=18-97). Genetic
      correlations were calculated using a variance components approach between the
      cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8, and Lifetime Suicide Attempt and Current
      Suicidal Ideation. The potentially confounding effects of sex and BMI were
      considered. RESULTS: 159 individuals endorse a Lifetime Suicide Attempt. IL-8 and
      IL-6 shared significant genetic overlap with risk for suicide attempt (rhog=0.49,
      pFDR=7.67x10(-03); rhog=0.53, pFDR=0.01), but for IL-6 this was attenuated when
      BMI was included as a covariate (rhog=0.37, se=0.23, pFDR=0.12). Suicide attempts
      were significantly more common in females (pFDR=0.01) and the genetic overlap
      between IL-8 and risk for suicide attempt was significant in females (rhog=0.56, 
      pFDR=0.01), but not in males (rhog=0.44, pFDR=0.30). DISCUSSION: These results
      demonstrate that: IL-8 shares genetic influences with risk for suicide attempt;
      females drove this effect; and BMI should be considered when assessing the
      association between IL-6 and suicide. This finding represents a significant
      advancement in knowledge by demonstrating that cytokine alterations are not
      simply a secondary manifestation of suicidal behavior, but rather, the
      pathophysiology of suicide attempts is, at least partly, underpinned by the same 
      biological mechanisms responsible for regulating inflammatory response.

TI  - Evidence for genetic correlation between human cerebral white matter
      microstructure and inflammation.
LID - 10.1002/hbm.24694 [doi]
AB  - White matter microstructure is affected by immune system activity via the actions
      of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. Although white matter microstructure
      and inflammatory measures are significantly heritable, it is unclear if
      overlapping genetic factors influence these traits in humans. We conducted
      genetic correlation analyses of these traits using randomly ascertained extended 
      pedigrees from the Genetics of Brain Structure and Function Study (N = 1862, 59% 
      females, ages 18-97 years; 42 +/- 15.7). White matter microstructure was assessed
      using fractional anisotropy (FA) calculated from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). 
      Circulating levels (pg/mL) of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and
      TNFalpha) phenotypically associated with white matter microstructure were
      quantified from blood serum. All traits were significantly heritable (h(2)
      ranging from 0.41 to 0.66 for DTI measures and from 0.18 to 0.30 for inflammatory
      markers). Phenotypically, higher levels of circulating inflammatory markers were 
      associated with lower FA values across the brain (r = -.03 to r = -.17). There
      were significant negative genetic correlations between most DTI measures and IL-8
      and TNFalpha, although effects for TNFalpha were no longer significant when
      covarying for body mass index. Genetic correlations between DTI measures and IL-6
      were not significant. Understanding the genetic correlation between specific
      inflammatory markers and DTI measures may help researchers focus questions
      related to inflammatory processes and brain structure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Disruptions in the decision-making processes that guide action
      selection are a core feature of many psychiatric disorders, including addiction. 
      Decision making is influenced by the goal-directed and habitual systems that can 
      be computationally characterized using model-based and model-free reinforcement
      learning algorithms, respectively. Recent evidence suggests an imbalance in the
      influence of these reinforcement learning systems on behavior in individuals with
      substance dependence, but it is unknown whether these disruptions are a
      manifestation of chronic drug use and/or are a preexisting risk factor for
      addiction. METHODS: We trained adult male rats on a multistage decision-making
      task to quantify model-free and model-based processes before and after
      self-administration of methamphetamine or saline. RESULTS: Individual differences
      in model-free, but not model-based, learning prior to any drug use predicted
      subsequent methamphetamine self-administration; rats with lower model-free
      behavior took more methamphetamine than rats with higher model-free behavior.
      This relationship was selective to model-free updating following a rewarded, but 
      not unrewarded, choice. Both model-free and model-based learning were reduced in 
      rats following methamphetamine self-administration, which was due to a decrement 
      in the ability of rats to use unrewarded outcomes appropriately. Moreover, the
      magnitude of drug-induced disruptions in model-free learning was not correlated
      with disruptions in model-based behavior, indicating that drug
      self-administration independently altered both reinforcement learning strategies.
      CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide direct evidence that model-free and
      model-based learning mechanisms are involved in select aspects of addiction
      vulnerability and pathology, and they provide a unique behavioral platform for
      conducting systems-level analyses of decision making in preclinical models of
      mental illness.

TI  - A QTL on chromosome 3q23 influences processing speed in humans.
PG  - e12530
LID - 10.1111/gbb.12530 [doi]
AB  - Processing speed is a psychological construct that refers to the speed with which
      an individual can perform any cognitive operation. Processing speed correlates
      strongly with general cognitive ability, declines sharply with age and is
      impaired across a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Thus,
      identifying genes that influence processing speed will likely improve
      understanding of the genetics of intelligence, biological aging and the
      etiologies of numerous disorders. Previous genetics studies of processing speed
      have relied on simple phenotypes (eg, mean reaction time) derived from single
      tasks. This strategy assumes, erroneously, that processing speed is a unitary
      construct. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the genetic
      architecture of processing speed by using a multidimensional model applied to a
      battery of cognitive tasks. Linkage and QTL-specific association analyses were
      performed on the factors from this model. The randomly ascertained sample
      comprised 1291 Mexican-American individuals from extended pedigrees. We found
      that performance on all three distinct processing-speed factors (Psychomotor
      Speed; Sequencing and Shifting and Verbal Fluency) were moderately and
      significantly heritable. We identified a genome-wide significant quantitative
      trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 3q23 for Psychomotor Speed (LOD = 4.83). Within
      this locus, we identified a plausible and interesting candidate gene for
      Psychomotor Speed (Z = 2.90, P = 1.86 x 10(-03) ).

AB  - As it is likely that both common and rare genetic variation are important for
      complex disease risk, studies that examine the full range of the allelic
      frequency distribution should be utilized to dissect the genetic influences on
      mental illness. The rate limiting factor for inferring an association between a
      variant and a phenotype is inevitably the total number of copies of the minor
      allele captured in the studied sample. For rare variation, with minor allele
      frequencies of 0.5% or less, very large samples of unrelated individuals are
      necessary to unambiguously associate a locus with an illness. Unfortunately, such
      large samples are often cost prohibitive. However, by using alternative analytic 
      strategies and studying related individuals, particularly those from large
      multiplex families, it is possible to reduce the required sample size while
      maintaining statistical power. We contend that using whole genome sequence (WGS) 
      in extended pedigrees provides a cost-effective strategy for psychiatric gene
      mapping that complements common variant approaches and WGS in unrelated
      individuals. This was our impetus for forming the "Pedigree-Based Whole Genome
      Sequencing of Affective and Psychotic Disorders" consortium. In this review, we
      provide a rationale for the use of WGS with pedigrees in modern psychiatric
      genetics research. We begin with a focused review of the current literature,
      followed by a short history of family-based research in psychiatry. Next, we
      describe several advantages of pedigrees for WGS research, including power
      estimates, methods for studying the environment, and endophenotypes. We conclude 
      with a brief description of our consortium and its goals.

AB  - Patients with psychosis exhibit subsyndromal depressive symptoms during the
      course of illness and yet the clinical correlates of these symptoms remain
      under-investigated. We aimed to investigate the clinical correlates of
      subsyndromal depression in psychosis including the extent to which they mediate
      commonly observed comorbid substance dependence. We developed a model of
      depression in a non-clinical sample recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk
      (N=266), and confirmed that model in a locally recruited African-American
      clinical sample comprising psychotic and non-psychotic individuals (N=256). Using
      scores from this model we tested: the strength of relationships between
      depressive symptomatology and positive, negative and disorganized symptoms in a
      range of psychotic disorders; whether depressive symptoms were higher in
      individuals with affective psychoses versus schizophrenia; and if depressive
      symptomatology mediated the relationship between psychosis and substance
      dependence. Subsyndromal depressive symptomatology was significantly higher in
      individuals with psychosis than without psychosis, but did not significantly
      differ between affective and non-affective psychotic groups. Depressive
      symptomatology was significantly related to positive (but not negative or
      disorganized) psychotic symptoms, and mediated the relationship between psychosis
      and substance dependence. The present study underlines the importance of
      assessing subsyndromal depression in patients with psychosis, and generates a
      number of testable predictions for future work. In particular, the examination of
      the relationships between comorbid psychopathology, namely depression and
      substance abuse, may improve insight into the neurobiology of psychosis.

AB  - Flexible decision-making in dynamic environments requires both retrospective
      appraisal of reinforced actions and prospective reasoning about the consequences 
      of actions. These complementary reinforcement-learning systems can be
      characterized computationally with model-free and model-based algorithms, but how
      these processes interact at a neurobehavioral level in normal and pathological
      states is unknown. Here, we developed a translationally analogous multistage
      decision-making (MSDM) task to independently quantify model-free and model-based 
      behavioral mechanisms in rats. We provide the first direct evidence that male
      rats, similar to humans, use both model-free and model-based learning when making
      value-based choices in the MSDM task and provide novel analytic approaches for
      independently quantifying these reinforcement-learning strategies. Furthermore,
      we report that ex vivo dopamine tone in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal
      cortex correlate with model-based, but not model-free, strategies, indicating
      that the biological mechanisms mediating decision-making in the multistage task
      are conserved in rats and humans. This new multistage task provides a unique
      behavioral platform for conducting systems-level analyses of decision-making in
      normal and pathological states.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Decision-making is
      influenced by both a retrospective "model-free" system and a prospective
      "model-based" system in humans, but the biobehavioral mechanisms mediating these 
      learning systems in normal and disease states are unknown. Here, we describe a
      translationally analogous multistage decision-making task to provide a behavioral
      platform for conducting neuroscience studies of decision-making in rats. We
      provide the first evidence that choice behavior in rats is influenced by
      model-free and model-based systems and demonstrate that model-based, but not
      model-free, learning is associated with corticostriatal dopamine tone. This novel
      behavioral paradigm has the potential to yield critical insights into the
      mechanisms mediating decision-making alterations in mental disorders.

TI  - Cognitive impairment from early to middle adulthood in patients with affective
      and nonaffective psychotic disorders.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1017/S0033291718003938 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is a core feature of psychotic disorders, but
      the profile of impairment across adulthood, particularly in African-American
      populations, remains unclear. METHODS: Using cross-sectional data from a
      case-control study of African-American adults with affective (n = 59) and
      nonaffective (n = 68) psychotic disorders, we examined cognitive functioning
      between early and middle adulthood (ages 20-60) on measures of general cognitive 
      ability, language, abstract reasoning, processing speed, executive function,
      verbal memory, and working memory. RESULTS: Both affective and nonaffective
      psychosis patients showed substantial and widespread cognitive impairments.
      However, comparison of cognitive functioning between controls and psychosis
      groups throughout early (ages 20-40) and middle (ages 40-60) adulthood also
      revealed age-associated group differences. During early adulthood, the
      nonaffective psychosis group showed increasing impairments with age on measures
      of general cognitive ability and executive function, while the affective
      psychosis group showed increasing impairment on a measure of language ability.
      Impairments on other cognitive measures remained mostly stable, although
      decreasing impairments on measures of processing speed, memory and working memory
      were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest similarities, but also
      differences in the profile of cognitive dysfunction in adults with affective and 
      nonaffective psychotic disorders. Both affective and nonaffective patients showed
      substantial and relatively stable impairments across adulthood. The nonaffective 
      group also showed increasing impairments with age in general and executive
      functions, and the affective group showed an increasing impairment in verbal
      functions, possibly suggesting different underlying etiopathogenic mechanisms.

TI  - Human Cortical Thickness Organized into Genetically-determined Communities across
      Spatial Resolutions.
PG  - 106-118
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhx309 [doi]
AB  - The cerebral cortex may be organized into anatomical genetic modules, communities
      of brain regions with shared genetic influences via pleiotropy. Such modules
      could represent novel phenotypes amenable to large-scale gene discovery. This
      modular structure was investigated with network analysis of in vivo MRI of
      extended pedigrees, revealing a "multiscale" structure where smaller and larger
      modules exist simultaneously and in partially overlapping fashion across spatial 
      scales, in contrast to prior work suggesting a specific number of cortical
      thickness modules. Inter-regional genetic correlations, gene co-expression
      patterns and computational models indicate that two simple organizational
      principles account for a large proportion of the apparent complexity in the
      network of genetic correlations. First, regions are strongly genetically
      correlated with their homologs in the opposite cerebral hemisphere. Second,
      regions are strongly genetically correlated with nearby regions in the same
      hemisphere, with an initial steep decrease in genetic correlation with anatomical
      distance, followed by a more gradual decline. Understanding underlying
      organizational principles of genetic influence is a critical step towards a
      mechanistic model of how specific genes influence brain anatomy and mediate
      neuropsychiatric risk.

TI  - Disentangling the genetic overlap between cholesterol and suicide risk.
PG  - 2556-2563
LID - 10.1038/s41386-018-0162-1 [doi]
AB  - Suicide is major public health concern; one million individuals worldwide die by 
      suicide each year of which there are many more attempts. Thus, it is imperative
      that robust and reliable indicators, or biomarkers, of suicide risk be identified
      so that individuals at risk can be identified and provided appropriate
      interventions as quickly as possible. Previous work has revealed a relationship
      between low levels of circulating cholesterol and suicide risk, implicating
      cholesterol level as one such potential biomarker, but the factors underlying
      this relationship remain unknown. In the present study, we applied a combination 
      of bivariate polygenic and coefficient-of-relatedness analysis, followed by
      mediation analysis, in a large sample of Mexican-American individuals from
      extended pedigrees [N = 1897; 96 pedigrees (average size = 19.17 individuals,
      range = 2-189) 60% female; mean age = 42.58 years, range = 18-97 years, sd =
      15.75 years] with no exclusion criteria for any given psychiatric disorder. We
      observed that total esterified cholesterol measured at the time of psychiatric
      assessment shared a significant genetic overlap with risk for suicide attempt
      (rhog = -0.64, p = 1.24 x 10(-04)). We also found that total unesterified
      cholesterol measured around 20 years prior to assessment varied as a function of 
      genetic proximity to an affected individual (h(2) = 0.21, se = 0.10, p = 8.73 x
      10(-04); betasuicide = -0.70, se = 0.25, p = 8.90 x 10(-03)). Finally, we found
      that the relationship between total unesterified cholesterol and suicide risk was
      significantly mediated by ABCA-1-specific cholesterol efflux capacity
      (betasuicide-efflux = -0.45, p = 0.039; betaefflux-cholexterol = -0.34, p <
      0.0001; betaindirect = -0.15, p = 0.044). These findings suggest that the
      relatively well-delineated process of cholesterol metabolism and associated
      molecular pathways will be informative for understanding the neurobiological
      underpinnings of risk for suicide attempt.

TI  - Genetic influence on cognitive development between childhood and adulthood.
LID - 10.1038/s41380-018-0277-0 [doi]
AB  - Successful cognitive development between childhood and adulthood has important
      consequences for future mental and physical wellbeing, as well as occupational
      and financial success. Therefore, delineating the genetic influences underlying
      changes in cognitive abilities during this developmental period will provide
      important insights into the biological mechanisms that govern both typical and
      atypical maturation. Using data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort
      (PNC), a large population-based sample of individuals aged 8 to 21 years old (n =
      6634), we used an empirical relatedness matrix to establish the heritability of
      general and specific cognitive functions and determine if genetic factors
      influence cognitive maturation (i.e., Gene x Age interactions) between childhood 
      and early adulthood. We found that neurocognitive measures across childhood and
      early adulthood were significantly heritable. Moreover, genetic variance on
      general cognitive ability, or g, increased significantly between childhood and
      early adulthood. Finally, we did not find evidence for decay in genetic
      correlation on neurocognition throughout childhood and adulthood, suggesting that
      the same genetic factors underlie cognition at different ages throughout this
      developmental period. Establishing significant Gene x Age interactions in
      neurocognitive functions across childhood and early adulthood is a necessary
      first step in identifying genes that influence cognitive development, rather than
      genes that influence cognition per se. Moreover, since aberrant cognitive
      development confers risk for several psychiatric disorders, further examination
      of these Gene x Age interactions may provide important insights into their
      etiology.

TI  - Dose response of the 16p11.2 distal copy number variant on intracranial volume
      and basal ganglia.
LID - 10.1038/s41380-018-0118-1 [doi]
AB  - Carriers of large recurrent copy number variants (CNVs) have a higher risk of
      developing neurodevelopmental disorders. The 16p11.2 distal CNV predisposes
      carriers to e.g., autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. We compared
      subcortical brain volumes of 12 16p11.2 distal deletion and 12 duplication
      carriers to 6882 non-carriers from the large-scale brain Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging collaboration, ENIGMA-CNV. After stringent CNV calling procedures, and
      standardized FreeSurfer image analysis, we found negative dose-response
      associations with copy number on intracranial volume and on regional caudate,
      pallidum and putamen volumes (beta = -0.71 to -1.37; P < 0.0005). In an
      independent sample, consistent results were obtained, with significant effects in
      the pallidum (beta = -0.95, P = 0.0042). The two data sets combined showed
      significant negative dose-response for the accumbens, caudate, pallidum, putamen 
      and ICV (P = 0.0032, 8.9 x 10(-6), 1.7 x 10(-)(9), 3.5 x 10(-12) and 1.0 x
      10(-4), respectively). Full scale IQ was lower in both deletion and duplication
      carriers compared to non-carriers. This is the first brain MRI study of the
      impact of the 16p11.2 distal CNV, and we demonstrate a specific effect on
      subcortical brain structures, suggesting a neuropathological pattern underlying
      the neurodevelopmental syndromes.

TI  - Perceptual grouping in the cocktail party: Contributions of voice-feature
      continuity.
PG  - 2178
LID - 10.1121/1.5058684 [doi]
AB  - Cocktail parties pose a difficult yet solvable problem for the auditory system.
      Previous work has shown that the cocktail-party problem is considerably easier
      when all sounds in the target stream are spoken by the same talker (the
      voice-continuity benefit). The present study investigated the contributions of
      two of the most salient voice features-glottal-pulse rate (GPR) and vocal-tract
      length (VTL)-to the voice-continuity benefit. Twenty young, normal-hearing
      listeners participated in two experiments. On each trial, listeners heard
      concurrent sequences of spoken digits from three different spatial locations and 
      reported the digits coming from a target location. Critically, across conditions,
      GPR and VTL either remained constant or varied across target digits.
      Additionally, across experiments, the target location either remained constant
      (Experiment 1) or varied (Experiment 2) within a trial. In Experiment 1,
      listeners benefited from continuity in either voice feature, but VTL continuity
      was more helpful than GPR continuity. In Experiment 2, spatial discontinuity
      greatly hindered listeners' abilities to exploit continuity in GPR and VTL. The
      present results suggest that selective attention benefits from continuity in
      target voice features and that VTL and GPR play different roles for perceptual
      grouping and stream segregation in the cocktail party.

TI  - Mapping cortical brain asymmetry in 17,141 healthy individuals worldwide via the 
      ENIGMA Consortium.

AB  - Hemispheric asymmetry is a cardinal feature of human brain organization. Altered 
      brain asymmetry has also been linked to some cognitive and neuropsychiatric
      disorders. Here, the ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through
      Meta-Analysis) Consortium presents the largest-ever analysis of cerebral cortical
      asymmetry and its variability across individuals. Cortical thickness and surface 
      area were assessed in MRI scans of 17,141 healthy individuals from 99 datasets
      worldwide. Results revealed widespread asymmetries at both hemispheric and
      regional levels, with a generally thicker cortex but smaller surface area in the 
      left hemisphere relative to the right. Regionally, asymmetries of cortical
      thickness and/or surface area were found in the inferior frontal gyrus,
      transverse temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex. These
      regions are involved in lateralized functions, including language and
      visuospatial processing. In addition to population-level asymmetries, variability
      in brain asymmetry was related to sex, age, and intracranial volume.
      Interestingly, we did not find significant associations between asymmetries and
      handedness. Finally, with two independent pedigree datasets (n = 1,443 and 1,113,
      respectively), we found several asymmetries showing significant, replicable
      heritability. The structural asymmetries identified and their variabilities and
      heritability provide a reference resource for future studies on the genetic basis
      of brain asymmetry and altered laterality in cognitive, neurological, and
      psychiatric disorders.

AB  - On average, patients with psychosis perform worse than controls on visual
      change-detection tasks, implying that psychosis is associated with reduced
      capacity of visual working memory (WM). In the present study, 79 patients
      diagnosed with various psychotic disorders and 166 controls, all African
      Americans, completed a change-detection task and several other neurocognitive
      measures. The aims of the study were to (1) determine whether we could observe a 
      between-group difference in performance on the change-detection task in this
      sample; (2) establish whether such a difference could be specifically attributed 
      to reduced WM capacity (k); and (3) estimate k in the context of the general
      cognitive deficit in psychosis. Consistent with previous studies, patients
      performed worse than controls on the change-detection task, on average. Bayesian 
      hierarchical cognitive modeling of the data suggested that this between-group
      difference was driven by reduced k in patients, rather than differences in other 
      psychologically meaningful model parameters (guessing behavior and lapse rate).
      Using the same modeling framework, we estimated the effect of psychosis on k
      while controlling for general intellectual ability (g, obtained from the other
      neurocognitive measures). The results suggested that reduced k in patients was
      stronger than predicted by the between-group difference in g. Moreover, a
      mediation analysis suggested that the relationship between psychosis and g (i.e.,
      the general cognitive deficit) was mediated by k. The results were consistent
      with the idea that reduced k is a specific deficit in psychosis, which
      contributes to the general cognitive deficit.

TI  - Human subcortical brain asymmetries in 15,847 people worldwide reveal effects of 
      age and sex.
PG  - 1497-1514
LID - 10.1007/s11682-016-9629-z [doi]
AB  - The two hemispheres of the human brain differ functionally and structurally.
      Despite over a century of research, the extent to which brain asymmetry is
      influenced by sex, handedness, age, and genetic factors is still controversial.
      Here we present the largest ever analysis of subcortical brain asymmetries, in a 
      harmonized multi-site study using meta-analysis methods. Volumetric asymmetry of 
      seven subcortical structures was assessed in 15,847 MRI scans from 52 datasets
      worldwide. There were sex differences in the asymmetry of the globus pallidus and
      putamen. Heritability estimates, derived from 1170 subjects belonging to 71
      extended pedigrees, revealed that additive genetic factors influenced the
      asymmetry of these two structures and that of the hippocampus and thalamus.
      Handedness had no detectable effect on subcortical asymmetries, even in this
      unprecedented sample size, but the asymmetry of the putamen varied with age.
      Genetic drivers of asymmetry in the hippocampus, thalamus and basal ganglia may
      affect variability in human cognition, including susceptibility to psychiatric
      disorders.

TI  - Implicit Talker Training Improves Comprehension of Auditory Speech in Noise.
PG  - 1584
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01584 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies have shown that listeners are better able to understand speech
      when they are familiar with the talker's voice. In most of these studies, talker 
      familiarity was ensured by explicit voice training; that is, listeners learned to
      identify the familiar talkers. In the real world, however, the characteristics of
      familiar talkers are learned incidentally, through communication. The present
      study investigated whether speech comprehension benefits from implicit voice
      training; that is, through exposure to talkers' voices without listeners
      explicitly trying to identify them. During four training sessions, listeners
      heard short sentences containing a single verb (e.g., "he writes"), spoken by one
      talker. The sentences were mixed with noise, and listeners identified the verb
      within each sentence while their speech-reception thresholds (SRT) were measured.
      In a final test session, listeners performed the same task, but this time they
      heard different sentences spoken by the familiar talker and three unfamiliar
      talkers. Familiar and unfamiliar talkers were counterbalanced across listeners.
      Half of the listeners performed a test session in which the four talkers were
      presented in separate blocks (blocked paradigm). For the other half, talkers
      varied randomly from trial to trial (interleaved paradigm). The results showed
      that listeners had lower SRT when the speech was produced by the familiar talker 
      than the unfamiliar talkers. The type of talker presentation (blocked vs.
      interleaved) had no effect on this familiarity benefit. These findings suggest
      that listeners implicitly learn talker-specific information during a
      speech-comprehension task, and exploit this information to improve the
      comprehension of novel speech material from familiar talkers.

TI  - The Processing-Speed Impairment in Psychosis Is More Than Just Accelerated Aging.
PG  - 814-823
LID - 10.1093/schbul/sbw168 [doi]
AB  - Processing speed is impaired in patients with psychosis, and deteriorates as a
      function of normal aging. These observations, in combination with other lines of 
      research, suggest that psychosis may be a syndrome of accelerated aging. But do
      patients with psychosis perform poorly on tasks of processing speed for the same 
      reasons as older adults? Fifty-one patients with psychotic illnesses and 90
      controls with similar mean IQ (aged 19-69 years, all African American) completed 
      a computerized processing-speed task, reminiscent of the classic digit-symbol
      coding task. The data were analyzed using the drift-diffusion model (DDM), and
      Bayesian inference was used to determine whether psychosis and aging had similar 
      or divergent effects on the DDM parameters. Psychosis and aging were both
      associated with poor performance, but had divergent effects on the DDM
      parameters. Patients had lower information-processing efficiency ("drift rate")
      and longer nondecision time than controls, and psychosis per se did not influence
      response caution. By contrast, the primary effect of aging was to increase
      response caution, and had inconsistent effects on drift rate and nondecision time
      across patients and controls. The results reveal that psychosis and aging
      influenced performance in different ways, suggesting that the processing-speed
      impairment in psychosis is more than just accelerated aging. This study also
      demonstrates the potential utility of computational models and Bayesian inference
      for finely mapping the contributions of cognitive functions on simple
      neurocognitive tests.

TI  - The lipidome in major depressive disorder: Shared genetic influence for
      ether-phosphatidylcholines, a plasma-based phenotype related to inflammation, and
      disease risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The lipidome is rapidly garnering interest in the field of
      psychiatry. Recent studies have implicated lipidomic changes across numerous
      psychiatric disorders. In particular, there is growing evidence that the
      concentrations of several classes of lipids are altered in those diagnosed with
      MDD. However, for lipidomic abnormalities to be considered potential treatment
      targets for MDD (rather than secondary manifestations of the disease), a shared
      etiology between lipid concentrations and MDD should be demonstrated. METHODS: In
      a sample of 567 individuals from 37 extended pedigrees (average size 13.57
      people, range=3-80), we used mass spectrometry lipidomic measures to evaluate the
      genetic overlap between twenty-three biologically distinct lipid classes and a
      dimensional scale of MDD. RESULTS: We found that the lipid class with the largest
      endophenotype ranking value (ERV, a standardized parametric measure of
      pleiotropy) were ether-phosphodatidylcholines (alkylphosphatidylcholine, PC(O)
      and alkenylphosphatidylcholine, PC(P) subclasses). Furthermore, we examined the
      cluster structure of the twenty-five species within the top-ranked lipid class,
      and the relationship of those clusters with MDD. This analysis revealed that
      species containing arachidonic acid generally exhibited the greatest degree of
      genetic overlap with MDD. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to demonstrate a
      shared genetic etiology between MDD and ether-phosphatidylcholine species
      containing arachidonic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid that is a precursor to
      inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins. The study highlights the
      potential utility of the well-characterized linoleic/arachidonic acid
      inflammation pathway as a diagnostic marker and/or treatment target for MDD.

TI  - Bi-directional audiovisual influences on temporal modulation discrimination.
PG  - 2474
LID - 10.1121/1.4979470 [doi]
AB  - Cross-modal interactions of auditory and visual temporal modulation were examined
      in a game-like experimental framework. Participants observed an audiovisual
      stimulus (an animated, sound-emitting fish) whose sound intensity and/or visual
      size oscillated sinusoidally at either 6 or 7 Hz. Participants made speeded
      judgments about the modulation rate in either the auditory or visual modality
      while doing their best to ignore information from the other modality. Modulation 
      rate in the task-irrelevant modality matched the modulation rate in the
      task-relevant modality (congruent conditions), was at the other rate (incongruent
      conditions), or had no modulation (unmodulated conditions). Both performance
      accuracy and parameter estimates from drift-diffusion decision modeling indicated
      that (1) the presence of temporal modulation in both modalities, regardless of
      whether modulations were matched or mismatched in rate, resulted in audiovisual
      interactions; (2) congruence in audiovisual temporal modulation resulted in more 
      reliable information processing; and (3) the effects of congruence appeared to be
      stronger when judging visual modulation rates (i.e., audition influencing
      vision), than when judging auditory modulation rates (i.e., vision influencing
      audition). The results demonstrate that audiovisual interactions from temporal
      modulations are bi-directional in nature, but with potential asymmetries in the
      size of the effect in each direction.

TI  - Serum phosphatidylinositol as a biomarker for bipolar disorder liability.
PG  - 107-115
LID - 10.1111/bdi.12468 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Individuals with bipolar disorder (BPD) exhibit alterations in their 
      phospholipid levels. It is unclear whether these alterations are a secondary
      consequence of illness state, or if phospholipids and illness risk overlap
      genetically. If the latter were true, then phospholipids might provide key
      insights into the pathophysiology of the illness. Therefore, we rank-ordered
      phospholipid classes by their genetic overlap with BPD risk in order to establish
      which class might be most informative in terms of increasing our understanding of
      illness pathophysiology. METHODS: Analyses were conducted in a sample of 558
      individuals, unselected for BPD, from 38 extended pedigrees (average family
      size=14.79, range=2-82). We calculated a coefficient of relatedness for all
      family members of nine individuals with BPD in the sample (N=185); this
      coefficient was set to be zero in unrelated individuals (N=373). Then, under an
      endophenotype ranking value (ERV) approach, this scalar index was tested against 
      13 serum-based phospholipid concentrations in order to rank-order lipid classes
      by their respective overlap with BPD risk. RESULTS: The phosphatidylinositol
      class was significantly heritable (h(2) =0.26, P=6.71 x 10(-05) ). It was the
      top-ranked class, and was significantly associated with BPD risk after correction
      for multiple testing (beta=-1.18, P=2.10 x 10(-03) , ERV=0.49). CONCLUSIONS: We
      identified a peripheral biomarker, serum-based phosphatidylinositol, which
      exhibits a significant association with BPD risk. Therefore, given that
      phosphatidylinositol and BPD risk share partially common etiology, it seems that 
      this lipid class warrants further investigation, not only in terms of treatment, 
      but also as a promising diagnostic and risk marker.

TI  - A comprehensive tractography study of patients with bipolar disorder and their
      unaffected siblings.
PG  - 3474-85
LID - 10.1002/hbm.23253 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diffusion tensor imaging studies show reductions in fractional
      anisotropy (FA) in individuals with bipolar disorder and their unaffected
      siblings. However, the use of various analysis methods is an important source of 
      between-study heterogeneity. Using tract-based spatial statistics, we previously 
      demonstrated widespread FA reductions in patients and unaffected relatives. To
      better interpret the neuroanatomical pattern of this previous finding and to
      assess the influence of methodological heterogeneity, we here applied
      tractography to the same sample. METHODS: Diffusion-weighted images were acquired
      for 96 patients, 69 unaffected siblings and 56 controls. We applied TRACULA, an
      extension of a global probabilistic tractography algorithm, to automatically
      segment 18 major fiber tracts. Average FA within each tract and at each
      cross-section along each tract was compared between groups. RESULTS: Patients had
      reduced FA compared to healthy controls and their unaffected siblings in general,
      and in particular in the parietal part of the superior longitudinal fasciculus.
      In unaffected siblings, FA was nominally reduced compared to controls in the
      corpus callosum. Point-wise analyses indicated that similar effects were present 
      along extended sections, but with variable effect sizes. Current symptom severity
      negatively correlated with FA in several fronto-limbic association tracts.
      CONCLUSIONS: The differential sensitivity of analysis techniques likely explains 
      between-study heterogeneity in anatomical localization of FA reductions. The
      present tractography analysis confirms the presence of overall FA reductions in
      patients with bipolar disorder, which are most pronounced in the superior
      longitudinal fasciculus. Unaffected siblings may display similar, albeit more
      subtle and anatomically restricted FA reductions. Hum Brain Mapp 37:3474-3485,

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and potentially life-threatening mood
      disorder. Identifying genetic markers for depression might provide reliable
      indicators of depression risk, which would, in turn, substantially improve
      detection, enabling earlier and more effective treatment. The aim of this study
      was to identify rare variants for depression, modeled as a continuous trait,
      using linkage and post-hoc association analysis. The sample comprised 1221
      Mexican-American individuals from extended pedigrees. A single dimensional scale 
      of MDD was derived using confirmatory factor analysis applied to all items from
      the Past Major Depressive Episode section of the Mini-International
      Neuropsychiatric Interview. Scores on this scale of depression were subjected to 
      linkage analysis followed by QTL region-specific association analysis. Linkage
      analysis revealed a single genome-wide significant QTL (LOD=3.43) on 10q26.13,
      QTL-specific association analysis conducted in the entire sample revealed a
      suggestive variant within an intron of the gene LHPP (rs11245316, p=7.8x10(-04); 
      LD-adjusted Bonferroni-corrected p=8.6x10(-05)). This region of the genome has
      previously been implicated in the etiology of MDD; the present study extends our 
      understanding of the involvement of this region by highlighting a putative gene
      of interest (LHPP).

TI  - Recurrent major depression and right hippocampal volume: A bivariate linkage and

AB  - Previous work has shown that the hippocampus is smaller in the brains of
      individuals suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) than those of healthy 
      controls. Moreover, right hippocampal volume specifically has been found to
      predict the probability of subsequent depressive episodes. This study explored
      the utility of right hippocampal volume as an endophenotype of recurrent MDD
      (rMDD). We observed a significant genetic correlation between the two traits in a
      large sample of Mexican American individuals from extended pedigrees (rhog =
      -0.34, p = 0.013). A bivariate linkage scan revealed a significant pleiotropic
      quantitative trait locus on chromosome 18p11.31-32 (LOD = 3.61). Bivariate
      association analysis conducted under the linkage peak revealed a variant
      (rs574972) within an intron of the gene SMCHD1 meeting the corrected significance
      level (chi(2) = 19.0, p = 7.4 x 10(-5)). Univariate association analyses of each 
      phenotype separately revealed that the same variant was significant for right
      hippocampal volume alone, and also revealed a suggestively significant variant
      (rs12455524) within the gene DLGAP1 for rMDD alone. The results implicate
      right-hemisphere hippocampal volume as a possible endophenotype of rMDD, and in
      so doing highlight a potential gene of interest for rMDD risk.

TI  - Genome-wide significant linkage of schizophrenia-related neuroanatomical trait to
      12q24.
PG  - 678-86
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.b.32360 [doi]
AB  - The insula and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) share functional, histological,
      transcriptional, and developmental characteristics, and they serve higher
      cognitive functions of theoretical relevance to schizophrenia and related
      disorders. Meta-analyses and multivariate analysis of structural magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) scans indicate that gray matter density and volume
      reductions in schizophrenia are the most consistent and pronounced in a network
      primarily composed of the insula and mPFC. We used source-based morphometry, a
      multivariate technique optimized for structural MRI, in a large sample of
      randomly ascertained pedigrees (N = 887) to derive an insula-mPFC component and
      to investigate its genetic determinants. Firstly, we replicated the insula-mPFC
      gray matter component as an independent source of gray matter variation in the
      general population, and verified its relevance to schizophrenia in an independent
      case-control sample. Secondly, we showed that the neuroanatomical variation
      defined by this component is largely determined by additive genetic variation
      (h(2) = 0.59), and genome-wide linkage analysis resulted in a significant linkage
      peak at 12q24 (LOD = 3.76). This region has been of significant interest to
      psychiatric genetics as it contains the Darier's disease locus and other proposed
      susceptibility genes (e.g., DAO, NOS1), and it has been linked to affective
      disorders and schizophrenia in multiple populations. Thus, in conjunction with
      previous clinical studies, our data imply that one or more psychiatric risk
      variants at 12q24 are co-inherited with reductions in mPFC and insula gray matter
      concentration. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although case-control approaches are beginning to disentangle
      schizophrenia's complex polygenic burden, other methods will likely be necessary 
      to fully identify and characterize risk genes. Endophenotypes, traits genetically
      correlated with an illness, can help characterize the impact of risk genes by
      providing genetically relevant traits that are more tractable than the behavioral
      symptoms that classify mental illness. Here, we present an analytic approach for 
      discovering and empirically validating endophenotypes in extended pedigrees with 
      very few affected individuals. Our approach indexes each family member's risk as 
      a function of shared genetic kinship with an affected individual, often referred 
      to as the coefficient of relatedness. To demonstrate the utility of this
      approach, we search for neurocognitive and neuroanatomic endophenotypes for
      schizophrenia in large unselected multigenerational pedigrees. METHODS: A
      fixed-effects test within the variance component framework was performed on
      neurocognitive and cortical surface area traits in 1606 Mexican-American
      individuals from large, randomly ascertained extended pedigrees who participated 
      in the Genetics of Brain Structure and Function study. As affecteds were excluded
      from analyses, results were not influenced by disease state or medication usage. 
      RESULTS: Despite having sampled just 6 individuals with schizophrenia, our sample
      provided 233 individuals at various levels of genetic risk for the disorder. We
      identified three neurocognitive measures (digit-symbol substitution, facial
      memory, and emotion recognition) and six medial temporal and prefrontal cortical 
      surfaces associated with liability for schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: With our novel
      analytic approach, one can discover and rank endophenotypes for schizophrenia, or
      any heritable disease, in randomly ascertained pedigrees.

TI  - Genome-Wide Analyses of Working-Memory Ability: A Review.
PG  - 224-233
AB  - Working memory, a theoretical construct from the field of cognitive psychology,
      is crucial to everyday life. It refers to the ability to temporarily store and
      manipulate task-relevant information. The identification of genes for working
      memory might shed light on the molecular mechanisms of this important cognitive
      ability and-given the genetic overlap between, for example, schizophrenia risk
      and working-memory ability-might also reveal important candidate genes for
      psychiatric illness. A number of genome-wide searches for genes that influence
      working memory have been conducted in recent years. Interestingly, the results of
      those searches converge on the mediating role of neuronal excitability in
      working-memory performance, such that the role of each gene highlighted by
      genome-wide methods plays a part in ion channel formation and/or dopaminergic
      signaling in the brain, with either direct or indirect influence on dopamine
      levels in the prefrontal cortex. This result dovetails with animal models of
      working memory that highlight the role of dynamic network connectivity, as
      mediated by dopaminergic signaling, in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Future
      work, which aims to characterize functional variants influencing working-memory
      ability, might choose to focus on those genes highlighted in the present review
      and also those networks in which the genes fall. Confirming gene associations and
      highlighting functional characterization of those associations might have
      implications for the understanding of normal variation in working-memory ability 
      and also for the development of drugs for mental illness.

AB  - Recognizing other individuals is an essential skill in humans and in other
      species. Over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that
      person-identity recognition abilities are highly variable. Roughly 2% of the
      population has developmental prosopagnosia, a congenital deficit in recognizing
      others by their faces. It is currently unclear whether developmental phonagnosia,
      a deficit in recognizing others by their voices, is equally prevalent, or even
      whether it actually exists. Here, we aimed to identify cases of developmental
      phonagnosia. We collected more than 1,000 data sets from self-selected German
      individuals by using a web-based screening test that was designed to assess their
      voice-recognition abilities. We then examined potentially phonagnosic individuals
      by using a comprehensive laboratory test battery. We found two novel cases of
      phonagnosia: AS, a 32-year-old female, and SP, a 32-year-old male; both are
      otherwise healthy academics, have normal hearing, and show no pathological
      abnormalities in brain structure. The two cases have comparable patterns of
      impairments: both performed at least 2 SDs below the level of matched controls on
      tests that required learning new voices, judging the familiarity of famous
      voices, and discriminating pitch differences between voices. In both cases, only 
      voice-identity processing per se was affected: face recognition, speech
      intelligibility, emotion recognition, and musical ability were all comparable to 
      controls. The findings confirm the existence of developmental phonagnosia as a
      modality-specific impairment and allow a first rough prevalence estimate.

TI  - Percepts, not acoustic properties, are the units of auditory short-term memory.
PG  - 445-50
LID - 10.1037/a0034890 [doi]
AB  - For decades, researchers have sought to understand the organizing principles of
      auditory and visual short-term memory (STM). Previous work in audition has
      suggested that there are independent memory stores for different sound features, 
      but the nature of the representations retained within these stores is currently
      unclear. Do they retain perceptual features, or do they instead retain
      representations of the sound's specific acoustic properties? In the present study
      we addressed this question by measuring listeners' abilities to keep one of three
      acoustic properties (interaural time difference [ITD], interaural level
      difference [ILD], or frequency) in memory when the target sound was followed by
      interfering sounds that varied randomly in one of the same properties.
      Critically, ITD and ILD evoked the same percept (spatial location), despite being
      acoustically different and having different physiological correlates, whereas
      frequency evoked a different percept (pitch). The results showed that listeners
      found it difficult to remember the percept of spatial location when the
      interfering tones varied either in ITD or ILD, but not when they varied in
      frequency. The study demonstrates that percepts are the units of auditory STM,
      and provides testable predictions for future neuroscientific work on both
      auditory and visual STM.

TI  - How do we recognise who is speaking?
PG  - 92-109
AB  - The human brain effortlessly extracts a wealth of information from natural
      speech, which allows the listener to both understand the speech message and
      recognise who is speaking. This article reviews behavioural and neuroscientific
      work that has attempted to characterise how listeners achieve speaker
      recognition. Behavioural studies suggest that the action of a speaker's glottal
      folds and the overall length of their vocal tract carry important voice-quality
      information. Although these cues are useful for discriminating and recognising
      speakers under certain circumstances, listeners may use virtually any systematic 
      feature for recognition. Neuroscientific studies have revealed that speaker
      recognition relies upon a predominantly right-lateralised network of brain
      regions. Specifically, the posterior parts of superior temporal sulcus appear to 
      perform some of the acoustical analyses necessary for the perception of speaker
      and message, whilst anterior portions may play a more abstract role in perceiving
      speaker identity. This voice-processing network is supported by direct, early
      connections to non-auditory regions, such as the visual face-sensitive area in
      the fusiform gyrus, which may serve to optimize person recognition.

      standard frequency is fixed and trial-by-trial feedback is provided. The present 
      experiment tested the hypothesis that fixing the standard frequency and providing
      feedback is advantageous for direction-impaired listeners because under these
      conditions the listeners can learn to respond correctly without genuinely
      perceiving frequency-change direction. This hypothesis was ruled out by the
      experiment. It appears instead that direction-impaired listeners find it
      difficult to ignore the irrelevant frequency changes introduced by roving.

AB  - In a series of experiments, Semal and Demany [(2006). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 120,
      3907-3915] demonstrated that some normally hearing listeners are unable to
      determine the direction of small but detectable differences in frequency between 
      pure tones. Unlike studies demonstrating similar effects in patients with brain
      damage, the authors used stimuli in which the standard frequency of the tones was
      highly uncertain (roved) over trials. In Experiment 1, listeners were identified 
      as insensitive to the direction of pitch changes using stimuli with frequency
      roving. When listeners were retested using stimuli without roving in Experiment
      2, impairments in pitch-direction identification were generally much less
      profound. In Experiment 3, frequency-roving range had a systematic effect on
      listeners' thresholds, and impairments in pitch-direction identification tended
      to occur only when the roving range was widest. In Experiment 4, the influence of
      frequency roving was similar for continuous frequency changes as for discrete
      changes. Possible explanations for the influence of roving on listeners'
      insensitivity to pitch-change direction are discussed.

TI  - Universal screening for intimate partner violence in the emergency department:
      importance of patient and provider factors.
PG  - 669-75
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Screening for intimate partner violence has been widely
      advocated in the health care setting, but efforts to assess effectiveness and
      ensure adequacy of universal screening are largely untested. We sought to
      identify barriers to screening of female emergency department patients for
      intimate partner violence during the first year of implementation of a screening 
      protocol. METHODS: A retrospective, structured medical chart review of 1,638
      randomly identified visits included demographic factors of age, race, marital
      status, employment status, insurance status, arrival mode, mechanism of
      presenting complaint, severity of condition, presentation time, and nurse gender.
      The study was conducted an an inner-city Level I trauma center with 43,000 annual
      ED visits and universal procedures for screening for intimate partner violence in
      place since February 1994. The participants were a cohort of 1,509 female
      patients, 18 years of age or older, who were discharged from the ED between July 
      1994 and June 1995. The main outcome measure was the odds of being screened as a 
      function of patient and provider variables. Statistical analyses involved
      univariate and multivariate logistic regression on screening rates (Yes/No) as
      derived from universal screening instrument variables. RESULTS: Of 1,638 records 
      reviewed, 483 patients (29.5%) were screened for intimate partner violence.
      Univariate analyses revealed that women presenting with nonpsychiatric, less
      acute complaints and those who presented during daylight hours were more likely
      to be screened than women who presented with psychiatric or more acute
      complaints, or during the night shift. Male and female nurse providers were
      equally likely to screen for intimate partner violence. Step-down multivariate
      analyses agreed with these findings. CONCLUSION: In this random sample of female 
      patients, screening rates varied by severity of the patient's condition, type of 
      presenting complaint, and presentation time.
