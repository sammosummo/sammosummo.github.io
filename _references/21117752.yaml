    In a series of experiments, Semal and Demany [(2006). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 120,
    3907-3915] demonstrated that some normally hearing listeners are unable to
    determine the direction of small but detectable differences in frequency between 
    pure tones. Unlike studies demonstrating similar effects in patients with brain
    damage, the authors used stimuli in which the standard frequency of the tones was
    highly uncertain (roved) over trials. In Experiment 1, listeners were identified 
    as insensitive to the direction of pitch changes using stimuli with frequency
    roving. When listeners were retested using stimuli without roving in Experiment
    2, impairments in pitch-direction identification were generally much less
    profound. In Experiment 3, frequency-roving range had a systematic effect on
    listeners' thresholds, and impairments in pitch-direction identification tended
    to occur only when the roving range was widest. In Experiment 4, the influence of
    frequency roving was similar for continuous frequency changes as for discrete
    changes. Possible explanations for the influence of roving on listeners'
    insensitivity to pitch-change direction are discussed.
