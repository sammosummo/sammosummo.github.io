Working memory (WM) is the name given to the memory system that stores information for short time periods, which is
strictly limited both in terms of duration and capacity. In this post, I present a model for measuring WM capacity from
psychophysical data using Bayesian hierarchical inference. (Disclaimer: This is a re-post from my previous blog. I was
quite happy with how the previous article turned out, so little has changed here, except for some changes to the code
and a plug for a recent paper of mine.)
