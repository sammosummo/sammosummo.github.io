# About me

I’m **Sam Mathias**, an Associate Research Scientitst at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu) in the [Glahn Lab](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/glahn/).

I was born in [Wigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigan), a medium-sized town in England. Wigan is perhaps most famous for its innaccurately named [wharf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigan_Pier) and the [voracious consumption of meat pies](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/british-pie-week-2018-wigan-pooles-potato-steak-kidney-onion-cheese-a8242376.html) by its inhabitants. It is home to [Wigan Athletic Football Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigan_Athletic_F.C.), who once won the FA Cup and were relagated from the Premier League in the [same season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012–13_FA_Cup). It’s also where [Wallace and Gromit come from](http://wallaceandgromit.wikia.com/wiki/Wigan).

I recieved my PhD in Psychology from the University of York, under the supervision of Peter Bailey. My thesis was about individual differences in pitch perception. I was a postdoc first at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany (under Katharina von Kriegstein), then at Boston University (under Barbara Shinn-Cunningham). During this time, I studied various aspects of auditory perception.

More recently, I transistioned into the field of statistical genetics under my current boss, David Glahn. I now live in New Haven.


I’ve studied a number of different things over the years, including auditory perception, depression, psychosis and the genetics of brain anatomy. I’m still interested in all of these areas and continue to publish on them. I very much enjoy the variety of my work but it does make it a little difficult to summarise my current research interests! I would say that I’m interested in individiual differences in perception and cognition, and characterising such differences using sophisticated statistical models.

# About this website

*The Cracked Bassoon* is my personal blog. I like to write about topics that interest me and post code whenever I have to solve a new problem. Obviously, the contents do not necesarily reflect the opinions of my employer or colleagues!

The name comes from a fun though not particularly accurate description of iterated rippled noise, an auditory stimulus used in the early days of auditory fMRI research.

# Publications

Here is a list of my peer-reviewed work. Feel free to email me for reprints!

# Code

Please visit my GitHub profile to see code I have written. My most significant project is Charlie, an open-source neurocognitive test battery written in Python, now in its second iteration.
