title: Power law of visual memory precision
---

_Visual short-term memory_ (VSTM), also called _visual working memory_, is the name for the collection of perceptual and
cognitive processes that allow us to remember visual scenes for up to several seconds after they have disappeared from
view.

VSTM is limited—we can't remember everything we have seen. One popular hypothesis concerning the limits of VSTM is that
we have a finite amount of VSTM resource that 


Within the last decade, there has been some debate about whether VTSM is best characterized as a store with a fixed
number of slots {{ site.data.refs.Luck2013a.citep }} or as a resource that is distributed flexibly between all items in
a scene {{ site.data.refs.Ma2014a.citep }}. One of the key findings in support of the latter view comes from 
*delayed-estimation tasks* {{ site.data.refs.Wilken2004a.citep }}. Briefly, the observer is presented with an array containing multiple visual items (e.g.,
colored squares), then, after a delay, the observer reproduces a feature of one item from memory (e.g.,
by selecting a color from a color wheel). The difference between the true and reproduced features resembles a
normal-like distribution. When modeled appropriately ({{ site.data.refs.Fougnie2012a.citenp }};
{{ site.data.refs.van2012a.citenp }}), the spread of this distribution increases with the number of items in the
array. This suggests that the observer remembers fewer items with greater precision and more items with less precision.

Assuming the flexible-resource view of VSTM is accurate, 

In their work on this topic, van den Berg, Ma, and colleagues ({{ site.data.refs.van2012a.citenp }}; {{ site.data.refs.van2014a.citenp }})
assumed that the relationship between VSTM precision and the number of remembered items follows [Stevens' power law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens%27s_power_law)
{{site.data.refs.Stevens1957a.citep}}. Since the data from several delayed-estimation tasks are [publicly available](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/malab/resources.html),
I decided to test this assumption here.

## Background

Delayed-estimation tasks typically use a circular response system, such as a color wheel, and therefore yield circular
data—that is, data in the range $$[-\pi, \pi)$$. Therefore,


as Fisher information and assumed that the relationship between precision and it followed a power law
