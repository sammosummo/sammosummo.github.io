Here is a small code snippet I find myself using quite often these days. The code implements a Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression in PyMC 3. It contains some nice convenience features, including automatically naming the coefficients and “compressing” the data set to speed up sampling.

The code isn’t perfect: for example, coefficient naming and compressing will go awry if the name of one of the columns in the data frame is a substring of the design formula. The hyperpriors might be too vague, especially for standardised covariates.
