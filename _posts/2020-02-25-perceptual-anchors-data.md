I'm very pleased to announce the publication of two new first-author papers. The first, which I co-wrote with Lenny
Varghese, Christophe Micheyl, and Barb Shinn-Cunnigham, reports one of the experiments I conducted as a postdoc in
Barb's lab [(Mathias et al., 2020)](#Mathias2020a). In this paper, we constructed a Bayesian model to explain listeners'
choices in a frequency-discrimination experiment. The data were collected several years ago while I was a postdoc in
Barb's lab. This paper was a very long time coming, but better late than never!

The code and data are publicly available in a [github repository](https://github.com/sammosummo/PerceptualAnchorsPublic).

The second paper, which may be of interest to a broader readership, is about the relationship between the amount of
cortical folding ([gyrification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrification)) and general cognitive ability
([*g*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics))). In this paper, I attempted to replicate previous
studies that reported correlations between these traits, and determine whether such correlations were caused by
overlapping genetic influences. I found that while gyrification and *g* were indeed genetically correlated, the
relationship between them was incredibly weak [(Mathias et al., 2020)](#Mathias2020b). 

Given that I didn't collect the data from either of the cohorts included in this paper, I'm not at liberty to share the
data here. However, one of them is the [Human Connectome Project](http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/), which is
available for free to all *bone fide* researchers.
