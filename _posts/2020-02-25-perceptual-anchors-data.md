title: Two new papers
---

I'm very pleased to announce two new first-author papers, both published in January this
year. At first glance, getting two papers published in the first month of the year makes
me look like incredibly productive scientist! But really, both papers are based on quite
old work and have been a long time coming.

The first paper was co-written with Lenny Varghese, Christophe Micheyl, and Barbara
Shinn-Cunnigham, and reports a small experiment I conducted as a postdoc in Barb's lab
circa 2014 {{ site.data.refs.Mathias2020b.citep }}. The paper is perhaps notable because
it's my first "fully Bayesian" paper, in the sense that it contains absolutely no *p*
values. Another first is that I've made the data and code publicly available in a
[github repository](https://github.com/sammosummo/PerceptualAnchorsPublic).

The second paper is from my current lab, and may be of interest to a broader readership,
given the subject matter {{ site.data.refs.Mathias2020a.citep }}. It's about the
relationship between cortical folding, or
[gyrification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrification), and general cognitive ability
([*g*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics))). We attempted to replicate
previous studies that reported correlations between these traits in groups of normal
humans, and determine whether such correlations were caused by overlapping genetic
influences. We found that gyrification and *g* were indeed genetically correlated, but
importantly, this relationship was super weak. The take-home message is that, in the
modern era of neuroimaging studies with huge samples, one needs to pay close attention
to [effect sizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size) when interpreting
brainâ€“behavior correlations.

The second paper used data from the [Genetics of Brain Structure and Function Study (GOBS)](http://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R01-MH078111-01)
and the [Human Connectome Project (HCP)](http://www.humanconnectomeproject.org/). Since I wasn't part of the
investigative teams that collected these data, I'm not at liberty to share them. However, the HCP data is available for
free to all *bone fide* researchers, and the application process is pretty straightforward.
