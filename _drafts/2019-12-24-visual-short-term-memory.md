*Working memory* refers to the short-term storage and manipulation of information lasting on the order of seconds
[(Baddeley, 2012)](#Baddeley2012a). It is considered to be a core process of cognition, essential to virtually all
deliberate behavior. *Visual working memory* refers to the subcomponent(s) of working memory that are dedicated to
visual information ([Luck, 2013](#Luck2013a); [Ma et al., 2014](#Ma2014a).

The above definition is fine, but I don't like it.
