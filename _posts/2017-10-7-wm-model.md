Working memory (WM) is the name given to the memory system that stores information over short periods, which is strictly limited in terms of duration and capacity. In this post, I present a model for measuring WM capacity from psychophysical data using Bayesian hierarchical inference.

**(Disclaimer: Some of what appears below was taken from an earlier post on my previous blog. The code has been improved, and I have included a plug for one of my recent papers.)**

The nature of WM capacity limitation is a source of current debate. Some researchers argue that WM is *slots-based*[<sup>1</sup>], stating that we can remember up to a fixed number of discrete items at once. Others suggest that WM capacity is a finite *flexible resource*[<sup>2</sup>]. Personally, I lean more towards the latter view. However, item-based storage has long been the dominant view, and the maximum number of items stored in WM, denoted by \\( k \\), remains a popular dependent variable in the cognitive sciences.

A simple way of measuring \\( k \\) is to apply a formula proposed by either Pashler[<sup>3</sup>] or Cowan[<sup>4</sup>] to the data from a change-detection task. On each trial in a change-detection task, the subject is presented with a stimulus comprising several distinct items (e.g., a visual array of objects) and after a few seconds, a second stimulus is presented. The second stimulus contains at least one item from the original stimulus (the probed item), which may or may not have changed in some way, and the subject indicates whether a change occurred. The choice of formula depends on whether the second stimulus also contains the remaining items from the original stimulus: if so, Pashler’s formula should be used; if it contains just the probed item, Cowan’s should be used.

These formulae are easy to implement and are widely used in research, but there are several problems with them. First, using these formulae, \\( k \\) can only be calculated from trials with the same set size — experiments typically include trials with various set sizes, so estimates of  \\( k \\) must be calculated separately for each set size and then combined, rather than calculating a single estimate from all the data. Second, since k can never exceed the set size, it is systematically underestimated whenever the set size is smaller than the true  \\( k \\). Third, the formulae can yield negative values of  \\( k \\), which are obviously impossible. Fourth, the formulae cannot be used to calculate  \\( k \\) at all when performance is at ceiling or floor.
