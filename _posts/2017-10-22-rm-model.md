A typical recognition-memory experiment requires subjects to memorise a set of stimuli (targets) and subsequently discriminate them from new stimuli (foils), often rating the confidence of their responses. In this post, I describe a Bayesian hierarchical model for applying signal detection theory (SDT) to data from such experiments.

A classic finding from studies of recognition memory is that receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are asymmetric. This asymmetry occurs because the variance associated with the target stimuli is greater than that associated with the foils. It has been suggested that ROC asymmetry could be a methodological artifact, related to averaging over items and/or stimuli, rather than a feature of recognition memory *per se*. This possibility was investigated by Pratte and colleagues, who applied a Bayesian hierarchical SDT model (developed in an earlier paper) which separated methodological and memory-based influences on the data. They concluded that although there were clear methodological effects, ROC asymmetry was indeed related to memory.
