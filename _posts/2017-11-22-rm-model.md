Signal detection theory (SDT) is useful tool for studying recognition memory[<sup>1</sup>]. Here, I describe a Bayesian hierarchical SDT model suitable for analysing data from recognition-memory experiments.

[<sup>1</sup>]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4867890 "Kintsch, W. (1967). Memory and decision aspects of recognition learning. Psychological Review, 74(6), 496–504."

A typical recognition-memory experiment consists of two phases. During the learning phase, subjects are presented with a sequence of stimuli (items). Later, during the test phase, subjects are presented with a mixture of new items (foils) and old items (targets), and are required to discriminate them. Recognition-memory experiments often use often confidence ratings. For example, subjects may be asked whether they remember the items by choosing from the following options: ‘definitely no’, ‘perhaps no’, ‘perhaps yes’, and ‘definitely yes’. In what follows, I assume that there is always an even number of response options — otherwise, a small modification to the model is required.

Let $$y$$ denote a subject’s response on a given trial with $$y =1$$ denoting ‘definitely no’, $$y=2$$ denoting ‘perhaps no’, and so on. The probability distribution of $$y$$ can be written as follows: 

$$
y_{i_j}\sim\textrm{Categorical}\left(p_{i_{j_1}},p_{i_{j_2}},\dots{},p_{i_{j_K}}\right)
$$

where $$i$$ indexes the subject, and $$j$$ indexes the trial, and $$K$$ is the number of response options (which must be an even number!). To determine the probabilities of each response, we need to assume a *decision rule* and a *perceptual model*. All SDT models contain both decision and perceptual components (see [<sup>2</sup>]).

[<sup>2</sup>]: 10.1016/j.jmp.2011.01.002 "DeCarlo, L. T. (2011). Signal detection theory with item effects. Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 55, 229–239 ."

For the decision component, we assume that on a given trial, a subject creates a latent variable corresponding to the perceived familiarity of the item, denoted by $$\psi$$. A negative value of $$\psi$$ means that the item is perceived as unfamiliar, whereas a positive value means that the item is perceived as familiar. Responses are based on $$\psi$$ in relation to several criteria, which are assumed to be fixed and stable across all trials in the experiment. Specifically, the decision rule is

$$
y_{i_j}=k\textrm{   if   }c_{i_{j_{k-1}}} < \psi_{i_j} \le c_{i_{j_{k}}}
$$

where $$c=-\infty$$ when $$k=0$$, $$c=0$$ when $$k=K/2$$ (hence the need for even $$K$$), $$c=\infty$$ when $$k=K$$, and any remaining elements are free to vary. When $$K=2$$, the model is equivalent to the widely used yes-no SDT model. This might not be apparent at first because under the usual formulation of the yes-no model the criterion is a free parameter, whereas here it is fixed. This discrepancy is rectified by the inclusion of a bias parameter described later.

The perceptual component of the model describes how values of $$\psi$$ are obtained. When the stimulus is a foil, $$\psi$$ is drawn from a Gaussian probability distribution with mean $$a_\textrm{foil}$$ and variance $$s_\textrm{foil}^2$$, Without any loss of generality, we set $$s_\textrm{foil}^2=1$$. When the stimulus is a target, $$\psi$$ is drawn from a Gaussian probability distribution with mean $$a_\textrm{target}$$ and variance $$s_\textrm{target}^2$$. Since the foil variance is fixed, it is more convenient to denote the target variance simply by $$s^2$$. A compact expression for $$\psi$$ is

$$
\psi_{i_j}=a_{\textrm{foil}_{i_j}}\cdot\left(1-z_{i_j}\right) + a_{\textrm{foil}_{i_j}}\cdot{}z_{i_j} + s_{i_j}^z\cdot\epsilon_{i_j}
$$

where $$\epsilon\sim\textrm{Normal}\left(0, 1\right)$$, and where $$z=0$$ for foils and $$z=1$$ for targets.

Combining the decision and perceptual components of the model yields the following conditional probabilities:

$$
\textrm{Pr}\left(y_{i_j}=k\mid{}z_{i_j}=0\right)=\Phi\left(a_{\textrm{foil}_{i_j}}-c_{i_{j_k}}\right)-\Phi\left(a_{\textrm{foil}_{i_j}}-c_{i_{j_{k-1}}}\right)\\
\textrm{Pr}\left(y_{i_j}=k\mid{}z_{i_j}=1\right)=\Phi\left(\frac{a_{\textrm{target}_{i_j}}-c_{i_{j_k}}}{s_{i_j}}\right)-\Phi\left(\frac{a_{\textrm{target}_{i_j}}-c_{i_{j_{k-1}}}}{s_{i_j}}\right)
$$
