Signal detection theory (SDT) is useful tool for studying of recognition memory[<sup>1</sup>]. Here, I describe a Bayesian hierarchical SDT model with confidence ratings, suitable for analysing data from recognition-memory experiments.

[<sup>1</sup>]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4867890 "Kintsch, W. (1967). Memory and decision aspects of recognition learning. Psychological Review, 74(6), 496–504."

A typical recognition-memory experiment consists of two phases. During the *learning phase*, subjects are presented with a sequence of stimuli, or items. Later, during the *test phase*, subjects are presented with a mixture of new items (foils) and old items (targets), and are required to discriminate them, often using confidence ratings. For example, subjects may be asked whether they remember the items by choosing from the following options: ‘definitely no’, ‘perhaps no’, ‘perhaps yes’, and ‘definitely yes’. In what follows, I assume that there is always an even number of response options — a small modification is required otherwise.

SDT assumes that on a given trial, the subject creates a latent variable which corresponds to the perceived familiarity of the item, denoted by $$\psi$$. A negative value of $$\psi$$ means that the item is perceived as unfamiliar, whereas a positive value means that the item is perceived as familiar. The subject’s response is based on $$\psi$$ in relation to several criteria, which are assumed to be fixed and stable across all trials in the experiment. Let $$y$$ denote the subject’s response on a given trial with $$y =1$$ denoting ‘definitely no’, $$y=2$$ denoting ‘perhaps no’, and so on. Mathematically, the *decision rule* can be written

$$
y_{i_j}=k\textrm{ if }c_{i_{j_{k-1}}} < \psi_{i_j} \le c_{i_{j_{k}}}
$$
