I'm very pleased to announce the publication of a new paper written by myself, Lenny Varghese, Christophe Micheyl, and
Barb Shinn-Cunnigham about using perceptual anchors during frequency discrimination [(Mathias et al., 2020)](#Mathias2020a).

In this paper, we constructed a Bayesian model to explain listeners' choices in a psychophysical experiment. The code
and data from are now publicly available in a [github repository](https://github.com/sammosummo/PerceptualAnchorsPublic).
