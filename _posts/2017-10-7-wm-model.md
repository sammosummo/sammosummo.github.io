Working memory (WM) is the name given to the memory system that stores information for short periods, which is strictly
limited in terms of duration and capacity. In this post, I present a model for measuring WM capacity from psychophysical
data using Bayesian hierarchical inference.

(Disclaimer: Some of what appears below was taken from an earlier post on my previous blog. The code has been improved,
and I have included a plug for one of my papers.)
