Signal detection theory (SDT) is useful tool for studying of recognition memory[<sup>1</sup>]. Here, I describe a Bayesian hierarchical SDT model with confidence ratings, suitable for analysing data from recognition-memory experiments.

[<sup>1</sup>]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4867890 "Kintsch, W. (1967). Memory and decision aspects of recognition learning. Psychological Review, 74(6), 496–504."

A typical recognition-memory experiment consists of two phases. During the *learning phase*, subjects are presented with a sequence of stimuli, or items. Later, during the *test phase*, subjects are presented with a mixture of new items (foils) and old items (targets), and are required to discriminate them, often using confidence ratings. For example, subjects may be asked whether they remember the items by choosing from the following options: ‘definitely no’, ‘perhaps no’, ‘perhaps yes’, and ‘definitely yes’. In what follows, I assume that there is always an even number of response options — a small modification is required otherwise.

SDT assumes that on a given trial, the subject creates a latent variable which corresponds to the perceived familiarity of the item, $$\psi$$. A negative value of $$\psi$$ means that the item is perceived as unfamiliar, whereas a positive value means that the item is perceived as familiar. The value of $$\psi$$ is drawn at random from a Gaussian probability distribution, the mean and variance of which depend on whether the item is a foil or target. The subject’s response is based on $$\psi$$ in relation to several criteria, which are assumed to be fixed and stable across all trials in the experiment.

A classic finding from studies of recognition memory is that target variance is greater than noise variance, or equivalently, that receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are asymmetric. It has been suggested that ROC asymmetry could be a methodological effect, related to aggregating over subjects and/or items, rather than a feature of memory per se. This possibility was investigated by Pratte and colleagues[<sup>2</sup>], who applied a Bayesian hierarchical SDT model (developed in an earlier paper[<sup>3</sup>]) which separated methodological and memory-based effects on the data. They concluded that although there were methodological effects, ROC asymmetry was indeed related to memory.

Let $$y$$ denote the subject’s response on a given trial with $$y =1$$ denoting ‘definitely no’, $$y=2$$ denoting ‘perhaps no’, and so on. The probability distribution of $$y$$ can be written as follows: 

$$
y_{i_j}\sim\textrm{Categorical}\left(p_{i_{j_1}},p_{i_{j_2}},\dots{},p_{i_{j_K}}\right)
$$

where $$c_{i_{j_0}}=-\infty$$, $$c_{i_{j_{k/2}}}=0$$, $$c_{i_{j_K}}=\infty$$, and $$z_{i_j}$$ denotes the type of item with $$z_{i_j}=0$$ denoting a foil and $$z_{i_j}=1$$ denoting a target. Linear models may be placed on the remaining parameters $$a_{i_j}$$, $$b_{i_j}$$, the remaining elements in $$c_{i_j}$$, and $$s_{i_j}$$. It makes sense to suppose that the means of the foil and target distributions — denoted by $$a_{i_j}$$ and $$b_{i_j}$$, respectively — are influenced by subject and item effects, plus any additional conditions or covariates:

$$
a_{i_j}=\alpha_{a_i}+\beta_{a_j}+\sum_{m=1}^{M}\textbf{X}_i\gamma_{a_m}\\
b_{i_j}=\alpha_{b_i}+\beta_{b_j}+\sum_{m=1}^{M}\textbf{X}_i\gamma_{b_m}
$$

where $$\alpha$$ denotes the random effect of subject, $$\beta$$ denotes the random effect of item, $$\textrm{X}$$ is a design matrix of fixed-effect covariates, and $$\gamma$$ denotes a regression coefficient.
