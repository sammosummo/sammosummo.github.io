title: Toggling features in Jekyll posts
date: 2019-08-17
has_code: true
has_comments: true

This website is written using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll allows me to do lots
of neat things, such as allow comments on blog posts, render mathematical equations, and
make code blocks colorful and readable. But to do all of these things, extra resources
(typically [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) or
[Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) code) need to be included in the webpage. When
these features aren't used, such resources are simply a waste of a reader's bandwidth.

Thankfully, there is a very simple design pattern that will allow resources to be loaded
only when needed. In a new blog post, boolean variables can be included in the
[front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/). For example, here is the front
matter of this post:

```yaml

layout: post
title: Toggling features on/off in Jekyll posts
date: 2019-08-17
has_code: true
has_comments: true
---
```

Here, the line `has_code: true` is [YAML](https://yaml.org/) that defines a Liquid
boolean variable. I can access it from my [layout file](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/)
called `post.md`, which contains these lines:

```liquid
{% raw %}{% if page.has_code %}
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ "/assets/css/code.css" | relative_url }}">
{% endif %}{% endraw %}
```

This is a hyperlink to ta stylesheet encapsulated within a Liquid `if` statement. The
extra stylesheet `code.css` is therefore only loaded for posts on which
I wish to use syntax highlighting. Granted, this particular example of this design pattern
is not terribly exciting. However, it is a component of several more quite nifty features,
such as dynamically building reference lists and displaying formatted code from external
files. I'll write about these in future posts.
