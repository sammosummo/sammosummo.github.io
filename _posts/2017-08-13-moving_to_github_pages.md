title: Moving to GitHub Pages

Welcome to my new blog! I’m in the process of moving my site over to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com).
My original site was hosted by [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com). While
I was very happy with DreamHost’s products and services, their cheapest
Shared Hosting plan had one major drawback: slow loading times. I mean _super_
slow. It wasn’t all that obvious on a home or mobile connection, but on faster
connections like in my office, pages would load noticeably slower than those
on other websites. I imagine that most readers of my blog will be academics,
and academic institutions tend to have pretty fast networks, so I expect
others will experience this too. Therefore, I’m moving.

GitHub pages is integrated with the static site-generating software, [
Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). My previous site was made using
[WordPress](https://wordpress.com), and I haven’t written any HTML for a
long, long time. But from what I’ve seen so far, it looks pretty
cool! Things have certainly moved along since the days of good old 
[GeoCities](http://blog.geocities.institute)!
