<h2>Voice morphs</h2>

<p>
  <em>Voice morphs</em> are sounds whose acoustic features lie in-between those
  of two real-world (or <em>veridical</em>) sounds, one of which is vocal
  (e.g., clear or whispered speech, laughter, crying) and the other is
  non-vocal (e.g., music, ringtones, boiling water).
</p>
<p>
  Each row in the table below contains example sounds from a different
  voice-morph continuum. Sounds in the first and last columns are the vocal and
  non-vocal veridical recordings, respectively, which were used to create the
  morphs. The second and second-to-last columns are synthesized versions of the
  original sounds, which were designed to sound as similar to the original
  recordings as possible. The remaining columns contain 0%, 20%, 50%, 80%, 100%
  morphs.
</p>
<p>
  In some cases, the global frequencies of the sinusoidal components of the
  synthesized sounds were shifted up or down prior to morphing. This was done
  so that the two ends of the continuum had roughly the same pitch, greatly
  improving the pleasantness of the subsequent morphs. The consequence of this
  frequency shifting can be heard between columns 2 and 3, and between columns
  7 and 8.
