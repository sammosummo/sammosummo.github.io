title: My bibliography
---

[Previously](references), I described how to automatically add references (citations and a bibliography) to Jekyll blog
posts. I use a related to method to automatically generate a list of my own publications, which can be seen [here](/publications).

As I mentioned in that [previous post](references), I have a collection of Python scripts that run when I build my site.
This collection also contains the following script, called `make_my_bib.py`.

```python
{{ site.data.code.make_my_bib__py }}
```

This script uses the [Biopython](https://biopython.org/wiki/Documentation) third-party package—specifically the
[Entrez](https://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/Bio.Entrez-module.html) subpackage—to grab a list of all my publications
from [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). It collects metadata from these publications, performs a few
hard-coded edits, and adds them to a YAML file called `my_papers.yaml`. It also appends data from another YAML file
called `my_papers_manual.yaml` which, as the name suggests, contains manually entered publications that are not listed
on PubMed. Here's an example item from that file:

```yaml
p201601re:
   authors: "Mathias, S. R., Knowles, E. E., Kent, J. W., McKay, D. R., Curran, J. E., de Almeida, M. A., Dyer, T. D., Göring, H. H., Olvera, R. L., Duggirala, R., Fox, P. T., Almasy, L., Blangero, J., & Glahn, D. C."
   title: "Recurrent major depression and right hippocampal volume: A bivariate linkage and association study"
   journal: "Human Brain Mapping"
   year: "2016"
   sort: "201601"
   pmid: "26485182"
   doi: "10.1002/hbm.23025"
   volume: "37"
   issue: "1"
   first_page: "191"
   last_page: "202"
```

These data are interpreted by following Liquid code embedded within the static page `publications.md`.

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% assign papers = site.data.my_papers | sort %}
{% for paper in papers reversed %}
  {% include citation.html %}
{% endfor %}
```
{% endraw %}

The array `papers` is sorted in reverse chronological order so that the most recent publication appears first. See my
[previous post](references) to see how `citation.html` works.
