# Mini biography


I was born in Wigan[^3], a medium-sized town and exemplar of the post-industrial North of England. Wigan is a funny place. It is perhaps most famous for its innaccurately named wharf[^4] and the voracious consumption of meat pies by its inhabitants[^5]. The following, completely genuine image says it all.

Wigan is also home to Wigan Athletic Football Club[^6], who are the only team in history to both win the FA Cup and be relagated from the Premier League in the same season[^7]. It’s also where Wallace and Gromit come from[^8].

I recieved my undergraduate degree, Masters and PhD in Psychology from the University of York[^9], all under the supervision of Peter Bailey. Peter is the supine participant in the image below. The other guy is a much younger me. My thesis was about individual differences in pitch perception.

York is my favourite place I’ve ever lived. I guess I’m not alone, because The Sunday Times named it the best place to live in Britain in 2018[^10]. I was lucky enough to spend about 7 years there.

I was a postdoc at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences[^11] in Leipzig, Germany, under Katharina von Kriegstein[^12]. I studied voice perception. There I lived underneath the Grieg-Begegnungsstätte Leipzig e. V.[^13], where the composer Edvard Grieg[^14] lived part time. This is the entry way:

I completed a second postdoc at Boston University[^15] under Barbara Shinn-Cunningham[^16]. I studied auditory short-term memory. Boston comes a close second in my list of favourite places.

I later transistioned into the field of statistical genetics under my current boss, [David Glahn[^17]. I now live in New Haven.

# Research interests


I’ve studied a number of different things over the years, including auditory perception[^18], depression[^19], psychosis[^20] and the genetics of brain anatomy[^21]. I’m still interested in all of these areas and continue to publish on them.

I very much enjoy the variety of my work but it does make it a little difficult to summarise my current research interests. At a push, I would say that I’m interested in individiual differences in perception and cognition, and particularly in characterising such differences using sophisticated statistical models.

# About this website

*The Cracked Bassoon* is my personal blog. I like to write about topics that interest me and post code whenever I have to solve a new problem.

The name comes from a fun though not particularly accurate description of iterated rippled noise, an auditory stimulus used in the early days of auditory fMRI research[^22].
