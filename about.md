My name is Sam Mathias. I’m a researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital. I’ve published
numerous peer-reviewed papers on a range of topics, including psychology, psychiatry,
and genetics. *The Cracked Bassoon* is my personal website.

### Minibiography

I was born in [Wigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigan), a medium-sized town in the
North of England perhaps best known for its inaccurately named
[wharf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigan_Pier) and the
[voracious consumption of meat pies](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/british-pie-week-2018-wigan-pooles-potato-steak-kidney-onion-cheese-a8242376.html)
by its inhabitants.

I recieved BSc, MSc, and PhD degrees from the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk)
all under the supervision of [Peter Bailey](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/emeritusfaculty/pjb1/).
*The Sunday Times* named York [the best place to live in Britain in 2018](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/york-best-places-to-live-8grhj85sn).
I was fortunate to spend about seven years there.

I was a postdoc at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](https://www.mpg.de/149614/kognition_neuro)
in Leipzig, Germany under [Katharina von Kriegstein](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=6lGfJQMAAAAJ&hl=de)
and at [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu) under
[Barbara Shinn-Cunningham](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cz-8qKoAAAAJ&hl=en).

Later I transitioned into psychiatric genetics at
[Yale School of Medicine](https://medicine.yale.edu/) under
[David Glahn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S1egpyMAAAAJ&hl=en). I’m still in
David’s lab. The lot of us recently moved to the [Department of Psychiatry at Boston Children’s Hospital](http://www.childrenshospital.org/centers-and-services/departments-and-divisions/department-of-psychiatry).

I currently live in [Charlestown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlestown,_Boston) with my wife,
[Emma Knowles](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RLeVS8IAAAAJ&hl=en). She is the
superior scientist by every metric. Please check out her work. We have a goldendoodle
named Charlie.

### How I made *The Cracked Bassoon*

The name of this website comes from a fun but inaccurate description of iterated rippled
noise, an auditory stimulus used in the early days of auditory fMRI research.

The site was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted
on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I bought the domain from
[Google Domains](https://domains.google/).

It doesn't use a “theme”. Instead I cloned [Michael Cypher](http://cypher.codes)'s website and
made some minor changes.

The logo is a 1950s black-and-white stock photo colorized using [DeOldify](https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify).

The typefaces used for the title and main text are [Trocchi](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/trocchi)
and [Charter](https://practicaltypography.com/charter.html), respectively.

The background is from [Subtle Patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/).
