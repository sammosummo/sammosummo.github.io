  book_review: "A collection of not-bad short stories set before the events of the\
    \ novels. I listened to this after playing <i>The Witcher 3</i> (excellent) and\
    \ the Netflix show (naff). Geralt is a bit more proactive than in the TV show,\
    \ which is good, although everyone else is rather one-note. The lore is very interesting\
    \ and I would\u2019ve liked more exploration of it. Favorite story by far: \u201C\
    A Grain of Truth.\u201D"

  book_review: First in The Witcher series proper. It was OK. The various threats
    facing Gerarlt and Ciri are established clearly but perfunctorily. Pacing is slow,
    almost plodding, and it ends at a strange point. The writing is quite poor, in
    my opinion, but this could be due to the translation. Sexism is rife as usual.

    \ in viewpoint and quotations from secondary sources naturally require the full\
    \ cast, and while the ensemble largely does an excellent job, there are some unintentional\
    \ clanging juxtapositions in both vocal talent and recording quality. Offerman\
    \ and Sedaris are stellar, so it\u2019s fortunate we hear from them the most.\
    \ Saunders himself is OK, but sounded quite monotone\u2014a shame, because for\
    \ me the Rev\u2019s journey had the most pathos. Much of the remaining cast is\
    \ good, making the occasional dud all the more jarring."

    \ examine it or make a clear stand against it. Based on her other writings, I\
    \ think she could be considered somewhat of a racist herself by today\u2019s standards.\
    \ I guess you could say that her work is supposed to be difficult to process,\

    \ liked the focus on female characters and that it didn\u2019t shy away from the\
    \ violence done both to and by them. I couldn\u2019t imagine a male fantasy writer\
    \ attempting something as complex and nuanced as Syenite and Alabaster\u2019s\
    \ relationship. The magic system is pretty interesting."

    \ place, then why does change her mind so easily right at last second? Who the\

  book_review: "To give credit where its due, Sanderson certainly puts his back into\

    \ the best of the three novels published so far. There are some problems, such\
    \ as the occasional terrible attempts at humor, and the many one-note characters.\
    \ The writing is decent, but doesn\u2019t have much flair. But if you\u2019re\
    \ into Sanderson, I imagine it\u2019s because of the super-intricate world-building\
    \ and meticulous plotting, which <i>The Way of Kings</i> definitely has those\
    \ in spades. I think it\u2019s surprisingly well-paced for its length."

  book: 6
  book_review: I was slightly disappointed by this. The series is universally loved,
    and perhaps it gets better, but I found the plot to be basic and derivative of
    <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>. Bunch of teenagers (cf. hobbits) moving from one
    place to another, meeting strange people and creatures, getting separated then
    reunited, eventually finding out they are part of some grand scheme to save the
    world. Clearly aimed at the Young Adult crowd.

    ethereal galactic conflict. Perhaps things get more interesting later on in the

  book_review: There is not much point reviewing these novels separately given that
    they are so clearly volumes of the same work, but for what its worth, the bit
    with Jonas in the antechamber, which occurs in this one, might be my favorite
    part of the series.

    \ I thought I detected a very slight shift in tone and didn\u2019t enjoy it quite\
    \ as much as the series proper. Nevertheless, it concludes Severian\u2019s story\
    \ in a way that is entirely consistent with the previous books, and I found it\

  book: 8
  book_review: "Falls squarely into the dark fantasy subgenre with its generous helpings\
    \ of graphic violence and its flawed, morally ambiguous characters\u2014and, unfortunately,\
    \ an undercurrent of misogyny. There are two female characters in the whole novel,\
    \ each embodying a one-note archetype (feral ultra-warrior and object of the male\
    \ gaze). The world of The First Law seems a bit bland compared to others (cf.\
    \ The Black Company; Malazan Book of the Fallen). But despite all of this, I actually\
    \ enjoyed <i>The Blade Itself</i> very much! I found Logen and Sand interesting\
    \ characters, and I laughed out loud at several points, usually at Jezal\u2019\
    s internal monologues."
