Signal detection theory (SDT) is useful tool for studying of recognition memory[<sup>1</sup>]. Here, I describe a Bayesian hierarchical SDT model with confidence ratings, suitable for analysing data from recognition-memory experiments.

[<sup>1</sup>]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4867890 "Kintsch, W. (1967). Memory and decision aspects of recognition learning. Psychological Review, 74(6), 496–504."

A typical recognition-memory experiment consists of two phases. During the *learning phase*, subjects are presented with a sequence of stimuli, or items. Later, during the *test phase*, subjects are presented with a mixture of old and new items, and are required to discriminate them, often using confidence ratings. For example, subjects may be asked whether they remember the items by choosing from the following options: ‘definitely no’, ‘perhaps no’, ‘perhaps yes’, and ‘definitely yes’. In what follows, I assume that there is always an even number of response options; a small modification is required otherwise.

Let $$K$$ denote the number of response options, and let $$y$$ denote the subject’s response on a given trial with $$y =1$$ denoting ‘definitely no’, $$y=2$$ denoting ‘perhaps no’, and so on. The probability distribution of $$y$$ can be written as follows: 

$$
y_{i_j}\sim\textrm{Categorical}\left(\textbf{p}_{i_j}\right)
$$

where $$\textbf{p}_{i_j}$$ is the row matrix of probabilities $$\textbf{p}_{i_j}=\left[p_{i_{j_1}},p_{i_{j_2}},\dots{},p_{i_{j_K}}\right]$$, $$i$$ indexes the subject, and $$j$$ indexes the trial. The probabilities are determined by

$$
p_{i_{j_k}}=\left[\Phi\left(\frac{a_{i_j}-c_{i_k}}{s}\right) - \Phi\left(\frac{}{}\right)\right]x
$$
