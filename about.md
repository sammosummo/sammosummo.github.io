*Me on [Exit Glacier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_Glacier) at Kenai Fjords National
Park, AK.*

My name is **Samuel Robert Mathias**. I’m a researcher at [Boston Children’s Hospital](http://www.childrenshospital.org/).
I’ve published numerous peer-reviewed papers on a range of topics, including hearing,
psychology, psychiatry, and genetics. You can find my list of publications [here](/publications)
or on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fRRZs_4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
[*The Cracked Bassoon*](https://crackedbassoon.com) is my personal website.

I was born in [Wigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigan), a medium-sized town in the
North of England perhaps best known for its inaccurately named
[wharf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigan_Pier) and the
[voracious consumption of meat pies](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/british-pie-week-2018-wigan-pooles-potato-steak-kidney-onion-cheese-a8242376.html)
by its inhabitants. I recieved BSc, MSc, and PhD degrees from the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk)
all under the supervision of [Peter Bailey](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/emeritusfaculty/pjb1/).
*The Sunday Times* named York [the best place to live in Britain in 2018](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/york-best-places-to-live-8grhj85sn).
I was fortunate to spend about seven years there. After leaving the UK, I was a postdoc
at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](https://www.mpg.de/149614/kognition_neuro)
in Leipzig, Germany under [Katharina von Kriegstein](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=6lGfJQMAAAAJ&hl=de),
and at [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu) under
[Barbara Shinn-Cunningham](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cz-8qKoAAAAJ&hl=en).
Later I worked at [Yale School of Medicine](https://medicine.yale.edu/) under
[David Glahn](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S1egpyMAAAAJ&hl=en). I now work in
the [Department of Psychiatry at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH)](http://www.childrenshospital.org/centers-and-services/departments/psychiatry).

*Me back in 2009-ish operating an MEG scanner with Peter playing the role of
participant.*

I currently live in [Charlestown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlestown,_Boston) with my wife,
[Emma Knowles](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RLeVS8IAAAAJ&hl=en). She is the
superior scientist by every metric. Please check out her work. We have a goldendoodle
named Charlie.

## How I made *The Cracked Bassoon*
This website was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is hosted
on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I bought the domain from [Google Domains](https://domains.google/).
I didn’t like any of the available Jekyll “themes” and don’t know how to build my own, so
I styled it using plain old HTML and CSS, from a clone of [Michael Cypher](http://cypher.codes)’s
website. The logo is a 1950s black-and-white stock photo colorized using [DeOldify](https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify).
The typefaces used for the title and main text are [Trocchi](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/trocchi)
and [Charter](https://practicaltypography.com/charter.html), respectively. The name comes from a fun but inaccurate description of iterated rippled
noise, an auditory stimulus used in the early days of auditory fMRI research.

If my style of writing seems strange to you, it could be because I’m an Englishman who
spends most of his time reading and writing American English. My own style has
become a strange mixture of the two. I endeavor (not “endeavour”) to conform to standard
US spelling and punctuation, but can’t resist a good British idiom from time to time.
